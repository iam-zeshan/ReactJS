/*
While making component in React we can use both function and classes.

The code editor has a function called MyComponent. Complete this function so it returns a single div element which contains some string of text.

Note: The text is considered a child of the div element, so you will not be able to use a self-closing tag.

const MyComponent = function() {
  // Change code below this line



  // Change code above this line
}
*/

const MyComponent = function() {
    // Change code below this line
    return (
      <div>
        "some string text"
      </div>
    );
    // Change code above this line
  }
