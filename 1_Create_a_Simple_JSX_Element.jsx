// In simple words ReactJS is the some sort of combination of the JavaScript and the HTML, and the file called the JSX file. and we can write JavaScritp code in the HTML using curly braces '{}'. And because this is not the actuall JavaScript language so we during execution this code in the JSX first need to be converted with the help of Babel.

//The current code uses JSX to assign a div element to the constant JSX. Replace the div with an h1 element and add the text Hello JSX! inside it.

const JSX = <h1>Hello JSX!</h1>;
