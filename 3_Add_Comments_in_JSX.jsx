/*
Writing comments in JSX we use the following syntax

The code editor has a JSX element similar to what you created in the last challenge. Add a comment somewhere within the provided div element, without modifying the existing h1 or p elements.

const JSX = (
  <div>
    <h1>This is a block of JSX</h1>
    <p>Here's a subtitle</p>
  </div>
);
*/

const JSX = (
  <div>
    <h1>This is a block of JSX</h1>
    <p>Here's a subtitle</p>
    {/*this is the comment syntax in JSX*/}
  </div>
);
